This is a boilerplate example of using React with Vite, Sass, Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, React Router and React Easier.

The example shows you a good starting point for using these frameworks/libraries together.

### How to use
* Download.
* Run **npm install** once and then run **npm start** to start the app.
* Create a production version by running **npm run build** and then **npm run backend**.

### Documentation of the individual libraries
Documentation of the individual libraries can be found here:

*   [React](https://react.dev)
*   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
*   [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
*   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
*   [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app)
*   [React Router](https://reactrouter.com)
*   [React Easier](https://react-easier.nodehill.com)

### Look at the code to learn!
Don't forget to [look at the source code](https://github.com/ironboy/Cool-things) of this example (and the [Products](/products) section) - it shows you a lot of basics and nifty tricks when using the libraries together!

### Some other libraries as well...
Although the example mainly focuses on the libraries mentioned above we also use:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [Express](https://expressjs.com) to build a small backend.
* [React Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown/#readme) to convert markdown to html within React.
* A [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database for our products and the [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/blob/master/docs/api.md)-driver for Node.js.
* If you want to take a look at the database - open it with an editor such as [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/).
* The npm modules [concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently#readme) (to start the backend and the Vite dev server in tandem) and [nodemon](https://nodemon.io) (to watch and reload on changes to the backend).
